## Backend

The backend of our ecommerce is responsible for managing product data and APIs. To start the backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend folder and insert the following information:
   ```sh
   INSERT YOUR REQUIRED API KEYS
   ```

3. Install the backend dependencies using npm:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend with nodemon:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Frontend

The frontend is what users will see and interact with to explore your online store. To start the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies using npm:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend with npm:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

You can now access the frontend via your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and start exploring our online store in development.
